Do you ever get that feeling of fervor?

When you are so harmonious, so in-tune, with your work, the hours slip by unnoticed? When you find your mind has curled on its own smile? And raw energy crawls out from the corners of your eyes, as the billowing nest within you can no longer contain your enthusiasm? And as your hand moves to complete that next bit of craft, you transcend humanity into the divinity, just for this one moment, just for the joy of your passions, and for the next moment, and the next.. and you never want to stop learning. And you never want to stop growing. And you are in joy with doing that which is naturally avoided, you are in joy with work. YOUR work.

Do you ever get that feeling, that it might all go away?

I do.

And I’ve worked not just so hard, but so persistently,  
to recover,  
to recover that feeling I once had as a kid.  
How does one reclaim, that sustainable fervor?

I’m not entirely sure how or why I stumbled onto [Jenova Chen’s thesis on flow](http://www.jenovachen.com/flowingames/thesis.htm"), or why it resonated so strongly with me, so I’m not going to even bother elaborating. Just know that it’s super awesome and somehow brain-synced me into looking at game-design with a new and critical eye. More importantly, it nudged together the seedling threads of design through sense-feeling for me. And for that, I will be ever greatful.

Curious me I am, as I sit there, harumping through thatgamecompany’s job descriptions. I’ve never actually heard of a Feel Engineer before this, but after reading [_what exactly_](http://thatgamecompany.com/company/jobs/) that entailed. I just knew.. oh, that’s me. That’s what feels most important to me. _That’s_ what I feel fervor for.

..Will I actually go on to work at thatgamecompany? _shrug_ Don’t know. That’s not what is important to me. What’s important is their sample test sounds like a blast. And one way or another, I’d very much like to get paid to have fun.

### thatgamecompany sample feel engineer test
> Submit **a 3D game prototype that uses interaction design and aesthetics to evoke in players a feeling** of hopefulness. The prototype should feature a central character (not necessarily a person) that navigates through a 3D space.  
> We’re looking for a demonstration of your technical abilities as well as your design sensibilities so **focus on interactive design and moment-to-moment feedback** that best showcases your taste and skill set. We favor minimalist design, and would prefer to see **a simple concept executed with a high level of polish and a sense of depth**. Include any additional elements (objects, player mechanics, sound, etc.) as you see fit.

I’ve highlighted my focii in bold. I actually may end up veering towards a hopeful feeling as requested by the description, but it’s just the bare idea of evoking feeling through interaction and simple aesthetic that I find tantalizing. I’m eager to explore any and all emotion(s). But, I’ll hone it down just to one for this project. I’ll develop that more as I explore what the mechanics naturally apparate.

Now, in addition to that description, a handful of rules and regulations were stapled:

A couple favored factors,
>  We want to see:
> - Emotion through motion and interaction
> - Technical wonder
> - Depth of moment-to-moment feedback
> - Thoughtful, cohesive design choices

And a couple stipends,
>  Limit reliance on:
> - Explicit narrative (characters, plot, objectives)
> - Detailed models, animations, or textures
> - World/level layout
> - ..write your demo in C or C++ or Javascript/WebGL rather than using an off-the-shelf engine.

All in all, everything I wanted to do. I’m in. This project will be done in C.

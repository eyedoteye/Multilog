For those that know me more personally, they know I’ve struggled with some
pretty bad juju when it comes to mental health. And it wasn’t without a strong
will, extensive therapy, medicine, and the support of some _really_ great
people that I’ve been able to recover and transform my life into a positive
direction.

With that said, **I _still_ do not understand mental health. I do
not understand my condition; I _do not_ understand the symptoms; I do not
understand my treatment.** What I do understand, is that I was given a
choice. I was given the choice to let my deteriorated mind be something that
consumes me, something that degrades me, something that takes away my autonomy
and controls me; or,<br>
I could let it be something I lean against, and push off. I could establish
_a relationship_ with this entity. I could soar. Because like it or
not,<br>
I am entwined.

And I can choose, to push that aside, ignore it as a part of me that isn’t me; I
can say that it’s not so real, and that one day it will dissapear and bother me
no more _--but--_ but to say that is to deny myself _in the
moment_. <br>
Because that’s what you have when you have an unfamiliar mind. You have methods
of molding the moment. Of molding your perception. Of _dealing_.

And that doesn’t mean I’m advocating leaping off reality to soar in the
otherworld. <br>
In fact, I’m advocating the opposite. I’m advocating the reflection with your
illness, that brings you forth to grounded feet. So rooted more in what it means
to be human, that the supposed nonsufferers look to you in awe, in how a tree
that extends _so_ far above the clouds can remain so stable. And as they
reach to enjoy the passions in your fruit, you unfurl your branch, and you
whisper to them your secret:<br>
“When I fell, I grew _twice_ as hard.”

![SphereKoan Design Doc]({{ sites.baseurl }}/assets/SphereKoan001.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I spent most of my time working with porting a different project of mine
today, but I managed to get a quick design doc out for the proto-type. You can
see the outline for this very blog post in there. :O!! Scandalous!

On the topic of funnies, I actually had to look up how to even shade a
sphere, and spent a good couple of a couple of minutes working on that legendary
concept art on the left side. It’s very simple, but I feel oddly proud.

Everything considered, I’m pretty happy with today’s progress. I have gotten
a lot of different kinds of work done. And Although admittedly not as much as
I’d like for this project in particular, I’m _very_ pleasantly surprised
I managed to get out this first log at all, and with a proper intro too!
Ohohoho, no corner cutting here. -Harumph-

Tomorrow I will make sure to take note of balancing the time spent between my
projects. That fervor must be distributed! No greedies!!

I’m i.i,<br>
and okay bye

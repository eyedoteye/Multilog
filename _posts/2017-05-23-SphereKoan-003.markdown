Good gosh, so much has occured since my last log two weeks ago. Both in my
personal and academic lives.<br>
There was some period of some great turmoil, that I think really brought forth
the preceding explorations. I suppose there is always a flower to bloom in the
darkness.

And so due to those complications, I think I'm going to unguiltily give myself
an extra week to complete my #thatgamefeel challenge. I think that wil be a more
useful measure, to me, of where I currently am.

However, not all news is bleak!<br>
I feel it's rather important to remain disciplined in growth, despite the
adversities and challenges in life. So I've planted a couple new roots within my
being.

- I've been deligently goiny through a demystifying mindfulness course
from coursera. I've even gotten accepted for a teensy-tiny scholarshiparuno! The
course has been really amazing so far. There is a lot of writing involved, and
that's pretty tiring, so I've really been getting a chance to excercise that
discipline.
- I've also begun illustrating, and have even started venturing into digital
painting. It's really fun and the act, in itself, is really encouraging.
- Good gosh, cold showers! After getting over the initial inhibitions, they
are actually _super amazing_! Lately I've been starting the shower warm,
and then slowly transitioning into cold. That way I get to experience the
best of both worlds, it starts as relieving and then it leaves me with a
great feeeling of refreshment.
- Oh, also! I've completely reorganized my room. It is now a low bed and
standing desk room. I've always believed that the room is a reflection of
the mind and vice-versa; so I'm really happy with this new setup.

On the SphereKoan front, there _has been_ some developments.
Notably, I am currently transitioning and updating my workflow to better
utilize YouCompleteMe. It's a little tricky because I'm compiling windows
programs, but I'm developing the linux subsystem. I've also been making good
progress on piecing together the architecture. I've been pulling pieces of
my old projects together and reworking it to an infrastructure better suited
for 3D-interactive projects.

Aside from the technical boring stuff, I've also attached one of my
behind-the-scenes, rougher design notes below:

and okay bye

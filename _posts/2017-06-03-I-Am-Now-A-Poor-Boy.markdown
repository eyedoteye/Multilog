SphereKoan IS ON PERMANENT HOLD!

I've come to realize my funs are simply to scarce for me to continue in its
development, and have been spending the past week redirecting my efforts towards
getting a job! And not a dummy, snore-snore job, but a _cool_ job! And so I've
been taking steps to produce more regular content via simpler methods such as
javascript (and later, unity)!

Also, I've sucessfully migrated the textual parts of my blog to this shiny new
home! Tumblr was proving to be quite finicky with longer text posts. And now
that I've gotten used to jeckyll, I see that there are a bunch of cool things I
can now do, that I couldn't ever before! Horizons expanded!!!

And do not fret over the hold on SphereKoan, I am sure I will get back to it
once my situation is in a more stable state. I really liked the idea and engine
I was building.

With every down there is always a new potential upward!
